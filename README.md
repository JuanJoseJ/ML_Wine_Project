## Description of the dataset
The dataset contains 10 classes regarging the quality of the wines and has been binarized: lower than 6 = 0 and greater than 6 = 1. Wines with quality 6 have been discarded.

11 features in total (attributes)

Classes are hard to separate, expect higher error rates (in the order of ten percent).

### Attribute Information:
