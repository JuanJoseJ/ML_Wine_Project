# Wine quality project - Machine Learning 2022

## Goal
Dataset contains 10 classes regarging the quality of thw wines and has been binarized: lower than 6 = 0 and greater than 6 = 1. Wines with quality 6 have been discarded.

11 features in total (attributes)

Classes are harder to separate than in the previous project, expect higher error rates (in the order of ten pe.
